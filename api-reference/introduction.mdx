## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens.

1. User Account ID and API Key are used as Basic Auth

    "api": {
    "auth": {
        "method": "basic",
        "name": "user account id : api-key"
    }
  }

2. The Subscription key is also put in the Headers

    "api": {
    "headers": {
        "Subscription": subscription-key
    }
}

3. Generate the Request to Obtain the Bearer Token
